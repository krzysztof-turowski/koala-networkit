The graph matching problem is among the most extensively researched topics in combinatorial optimization. Initial studies into the subject were motivated by practical issues including minimization of transportation costs~\cite{hitchcock1941distribution} or optimally assigning personnel to tasks~\cite{thorndike1950problem}. Over time, matching algorithms have found their use in scheduling, approximation algorithms and network switching among other problems. They play a crucial role in various other optimization algorithms including undirected shortest paths~\cite{lawler2001combinatorial}, planar maximum cut~\cite{hadlock1975finding}, metric traveling salesman problem~\cite{christofides2022worst}, and Chinese postman tours~\cite{edmonds1973matching}.
