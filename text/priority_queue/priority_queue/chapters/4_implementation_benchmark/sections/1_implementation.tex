\section{Implementation}

All priority queues described in this work were implemented in C++. The full open-source code is available in the \texttt{koala-networkit} GitHub repository at: \url{https://github.com/krzysztof-turowski/koala-networkit/pull/37}. Each data structure is accompanied by unit tests to verify correctness for basic cases.

\subsection{File Structure}

All priority queue implementations are header-only and organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{include/structures/PriorityQueue.hpp} – defines the common interface,
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/VanEmdeBoasTree.hpp},
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/XFastTrie.hpp},
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/YFastTrie.hpp},
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/WeakHeap.hpp},
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/SkewHeap.hpp},
  \item \texttt{include/structures/priority\_queue/RankPairingHeap.hpp}.
\end{itemize}
