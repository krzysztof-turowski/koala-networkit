\section{Introductory definitions}
In the following, a graph means an undirected, simple (i.e. there can be at most one edge between two vertices) graph. In the context of graph $G$, the set of its vertices is denoted by $V(G)$ and the set of its edges by $E(G)$. The definitions of this section or equivalent ones can be found in \cite{bollobas1998modern} or in \cite{DBLP:journals/eatcs/FominGK05}
\begin{definition}[cardinality]
The cardinality of a set is the number of its elements.
\end{definition}
For a set $X$, one denotes its cardinality with $|X|$.
\begin{definition}[frequency]
Given a family $\mathcal{S}$ of sets, the frequency of an element $u \in \bigcup \mathcal{S}$ is the number of sets $S \in \mathcal{S}$ satisfying $u\in S$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[closed neighborhood]
In a graph $G$, a closed neighborhood of $v \in V(G)$ (denoted by $N_G[v]$ or simply $N[v]$ in case $G$ is evident) is the union of the set of vertices adjacent to a vertex $v$ and $\{v\}$.
\end{definition}
