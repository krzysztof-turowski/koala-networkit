abstract = {The measure and conquer approach has proven to be a powerful tool to analyse exact algorithms for combinatorial problems like Dominating Set and Independent Set. This approach is used in this paper to obtain a faster exact algorithm for Dominating Set. We obtain this algorithm by considering a series of branch and reduce algorithms. This series is the result of an iterative process in which a mathematical analysis of an algorithm in the series with measure and conquer results in a convex or quasiconvex programming problem. The solution, by means of a computer, to this problem not only gives a bound on the running time of the algorithm, but can also give an indication on where to look for a new reduction rule, often giving a new, possibly faster algorithm. As a result, we obtain an O(1.4969n) time and polynomial space algorithm.}

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k 3. Here exponential time means 2 n for some >0. In this paper, assuming that, for k 3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k 3, define sk=inf{ :there exists 2 n algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k 3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk (1 d/k)s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2 nk -CNFs in fewer variables for some k k and arbitrarily small >0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2 n for arbitrarily small >0.},

abstract = {The Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) problem is a fundamental problem in wireless ad hoc networks. The majority of approximation algorithms for this NP-hard problem follow a two-phased approach: The first phase is to construct a Maximal Independent Set (MIS), and the second phase is to connect the nodes in it. The upper bounds of the MISs play a key role in the design of constant approximation MCDS algorithms. This paper considers this problem for 3D heterogeneous ad hoc networks, where the transmission ranges of nodes are allowed to be different. We prove upper bounds of MISs with two classical mathematical problems, the Spherical Code Problem and the Sphere Packing Problem. When the transmission range ratio (the ratio of the maximum transmission range over the minimum transmission range) is (1, 1.023], (1.023, 1.055], (1.055, 1.082], ..., we reduce the MIS upper bounds from the best-known results 22|OPT|+1, 23|OPT|+1, 24|OPT|+1, ..., to 12|OPT|+1, 13|OPT|+1, 14|OPT|+1, ..., where OPT is an optimal CDS and |OPT| is the size of OPT. With the bounds of MISs, the approximation ratio of MCDS algorithms can be reduced from 25.02 to 16.02 in heterogeneous 3D wireless ad hoc networks.}

abstract="Measure and Conquer is a recently developed technique to analyze worst-case complexity of backtracking algorithms. The traditional measure and conquer analysis concentrates on one branching at once by using only small number of variables. In this paper, we extend the measure and conquer analysis and introduce a new analyzing technique named ``potential method'' to deal with consecutive branchings together. In potential method, the optimization problem becomes sparse; therefore, we can use large number of variables. We applied this technique to the minimum dominating set problem and obtained the current fastest algorithm that runs in O(1.4864n) time and polynomial space. We also combined this algorithm with a precalculation by dynamic programming and obtained O(1.4689n) time and space algorithm. These results show the power of the potential method and possibilities of future applications to other problems.",
