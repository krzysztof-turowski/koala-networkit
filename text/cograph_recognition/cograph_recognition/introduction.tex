\section{Cograph information}
The discoverers of cographs include Jung (1978) ``On a Class of Posets and the Corresponding Comparability Graphs''  \cite{Jung1978OnAC}, who called them \emph{$D^*$-graphs}; Lerchs (1971) ``On cliques and kernel'' \cite{corneil_lerchs_stewart_81}, who reffered to them as \emph{hereditary Dacey graphs}; Seinsche (1974) ``On a property of the class of $n$-colorable graphs'' \cite{Seinsche1974OnAP}, who named them \emph{$2$-parity graphs}; and Sumner (1974) ``Dacey graphs'' \cite{Sumner1974DaceyG}. Cographs recognition can be done in linear time. The different recognition algorithms are listed in tables (see \Cref{tbl:recognition_algorithms} and \Cref{tbl:parallel_recognition_algorithms}). This work will discuss some of these recognition algorithms, compare them, and describe their respective advantages and disadvantages.

The subclasses of cographs include complete graphs, cluster graphs, threshold graphs, and Tur√°n graphs. An example of the complexity of a problem for cographs is that the weighted maximum cut is NP-complete for threshold graphs, and consequently NP-complete for cographs.

Regarding the superclasses of cographs, they encompass distance-hereditary graphs, permutation graphs, comparability graphs, perfectly orderable graphs, even hole-free graphs, Meyniel graphs, and strongly perfect graphs. An example is that the domination problem is linear for distance-hereditary graphs, and therefore linear for cographs.


Various results are known for cographs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the ability to find in linear time the maximum clique, maximum independent set, vertex coloring number, maximum clique cover,  Hamiltonicity \cite{corneil_lerchs_stewart_81},  pathwidth and treewidth, which are equal for cographs \cite{Bodlaender1990ThePA}. Additionally, there is $O (n^2) $ algorithm for simple max cut \cite{Bodlaender1994OnTC},
    \item NP-complete problems include determining whether a given cograph $G$ is a subgraph of a given cograph $H$ \cite{damaschke_91}, computing achromatic number \cite{Bodlaender1989AchromaticNI} and list coloring \cite{Jansen1992GeneralizedCF},
    \item fixed parameter tractable (FPT)  problems are determining whether a graph can be made into a cograph by deleting at most $i$ vertices, at most $j$ edges is fixed parameter tractable with respect to $i$ and $j$ \cite{Cai1996FixedParameterTO}, $k$-edge-deletion to cographs is solvable in $O(2.562^k \cdot (m + n))$ time and $k$-vertex-deletion algorithm is solvable in $O(3.303^k \cdot (m +n))$ time \cite{nastos_gao_10}, $k$-edge-edited to cographs is solvable in $O(4.612^k \cdot (m+n))$ time \cite{Liu2012ComplexityAP}.
