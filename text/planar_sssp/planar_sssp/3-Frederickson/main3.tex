In this chapter, we will describe Frederickson's SSSP algorithm\cite{frederickson}. The algorithm runs in $O(n \sqrt{\log n})$ time and utilizes a clever data structure-the Topology-Based Heap-to efficiently handle updates on a substantially reduced set of vertices. In contrast to Henzinger's SSSP algorithm, all vertices are stored in a single heap-like structure. To achieve the required update times, the structure is constructed to satisfy additional criteria enforced during the initialization stage.
