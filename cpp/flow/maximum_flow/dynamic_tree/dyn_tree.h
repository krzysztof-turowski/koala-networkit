/*********************************************************
  Usage of the dynamic tree routines:

  The main purpose of using this data structure is to deal with
  trees of any type of objects with a value associated with them. 
  See the literature! (linking-cutting trees)
  
  The user need only the dyn_tree.h header file and the object
  files which can be created with the enclosed makefile.
  All the other sourcefiles could be referred to as a black box.

  So the only requirement from the objects is to be linkable
  into a dynamic tree. Hence the objects (which are naturally 
  structures) have to be a member which is a void pointer.

  In fact the object is connected through this void pointer to
  the dynamic_tree node (which has another pointer pointing
  back to the dyn_item, and created by dyn_make_tree).
  This allowes to convert a pointer to the object into a pointer
  to dyn_item. 

  For example:
  typedef structure OBJECT {
     anything                 \
	 .                         >  with length offset 
	 .                        /
	 void * dyn_point;
	 .
	 .
	 .
  }object;
  
  object * objptr;

  It is wiser to place our "void * dyn_point" into the first field
  of the structure, but not necessary.
  And the dynamic_tree functions can be called as follows:

  dyn_make_tree((dyn_item *)((int)(objptr) + offset), value);   

  and so on.

  If offset == 0 then our objptr can be converted directly.
  dyn_make_tree((dyn_item *)(objptr), value);  

  And similarly careful returnvalue handling is necessary.
  If offset == 0 then objptr can be identified with a dyn_item * 
  type pointer from the dynamic tree routins' point of view.

  The DOUBLE type is a macro, which can be changed to int or float or
  any number type under the compilation from the command line or
  from the makefile.
